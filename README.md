Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge

After cloning this repository, use 'run.sh' to run the program from the terminal. The Python program 'code_challenge.py' (located in the 'src' directory) implements the following two features:
  1. Calculates the total number of times each word has been tweeted.
  2. Calculates the median number of unique words per tweet, and updates this median as tweets come in.

You will need to have Python's NumPy library installed before running.
