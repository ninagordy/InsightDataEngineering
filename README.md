Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge

After cloning this repository, use 'run.sh' to run the program from the terminal. 'code_challenge.py' (located in the 'src' directory) implements the following two features:
  1. Calculate the total number of times each word has been tweeted.
  2. Calculate the median number of unique words per tweet, and update this median as tweets come in.

You will need to have Python's NumPy library installed before running.
